<p>What's in it for you!<p>
<p>I hope those words sound familiar to some of you, if not then it's even better. 
	I had my piece of the first conference and to be frank, I really started to hate the whole idea of the conference. 
	Yeah, I know you are raising your eyebrows now but I really meant it. Why conference? 
	people say give a talk, communicate with people and do so called networking. 
	In my view, the whole idea of the conference is shabby and made sense only in the age with no internet. 
	It's not like I am bad in communication (though I am still learning) or I didn't get the chance to meet some of the 
	legends of the field instead I indeed met with almost all of the people I admire and I really don't want to hide 
	the thought that some of them really disappointed me. Their attitude itself was not in the right place let alone 
	the research and Yes I did confirm the reactions towards them by others too and double checked that it's not just 
	me who is going crazy. Anway I met very awesome people too which I am really glad about.<p>
<p>Coming back to the idea of having a conference so let me answer one by one. So give the talk, ok I gave the talk. 
	Now how was the experience? Oh!! buddy you are in for a treat now. I don't even know how many nights 
	I spent preparing it without sleeping, thinking while pooping, taking the shower and simulating all the things 
	which can go wrong or has already happened in the parallel universe (Not exactly parallel it should be ahead of 
	present but yea you got it). What happened in the talk? Something really stupid which I am really embarrassed 
	to even talk about. Anway that's not the point shit happens and you cannot really do much about it since it is 
	not in your hand but the thought how many people was really able to gain through the talk really troubles me.<p>
<p>When my advisor told me the idea of Analysis efficient computation I was really intrigued by the name itself. 
	The thought is simple enough but slick in a sense that you do only the necessary computation required for the 
	analysis. Even though the idea sounds obvious enough but believe me it's better said than done. The purpose 
	of introducing you to the idea is that conferences are doing just the opposite of the idea. I saw people attending 
	talks and that's really great and I appreciate people just for showing up it does take a lot of effort for that 
	itself. But their enthusiasm really wears away with the talk itself and if you are listening to the talk then 
	either you have already read the paper or know the author already somehow (At least that was true in my experience 
	with people I met). So what I want to ask you is  if you already know that guy or has seen his paper then why to 
	bother showing up.<p>
<p>Even if by chance you met some random new guy how much chance you have really got that it's gonna be fruitful. 
	I indeed met with some wonderful people and I really respect them but was it really worth after  five days of 
	the exhaustive journey. That's not analysis efficient which in my case I meant is time efficient. People who are 
	interested in my work are already following the work online and it's really hard to change someone's mind in 20 min 
	(to be exact it was 14.5). I am not saying it's not possible but it's again not time efficient.<p>
<p>To be frank I wanted to get this out from the second day of the conference itself but didn't get the chance. 
	Today I got in the mood with some alcohol in the system, I am gonna read this tomorrow again if it doesn't sound 
	logical I'll remove it. One of the advantages of writing less known(which right now is just me) blog is you can 
	write anything you want and don't really have to worry what others would say or think but if you are able to make 
	it till here I really appreciate it and let me know of your thoughts.<p>
