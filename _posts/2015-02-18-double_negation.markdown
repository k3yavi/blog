<p>I am taking Logic in computer science class this semester. Some days back professor was talking about 
	double negation and that it is equal to the original value, It is true but today, while taking shower 
	when I was revisiting the lecture in my mind this figure with double negation comes to my mind:</p>

<p>-(-(A)) = A</p>

<p>This is really true when you see from above. But wait, let me go back. when there was a need for 
	directions we develop vectors in mathematics saying we add direction with magnitude, or simply 
	we have just added one more dimension of complexity to a value. It's totally fine but if you see 
	the same thought in negation, we say it just changes the direction, ok yes it changes the direction 
	what if we again take the negation of negation we end up with the same direction. Even their magnitudes 
	are same but are they really equal? yes if you say in magnitude, yes if you say in direction but the 
	same question again are they really same? Professor says they are different creatures in Logic world 
	if they are compared by equivalence relation denoted by three parallel lines.</p>
<p>I believe we are missing something. what is really missing ? I really don't believe they are equal.-(-(A)) 
	is definitely more experienced than A. Then why is there no added dimension for that? why is there nothing 
	in mathematics which can really differentiate -(-A) from A. If you see that in terms of path in circle then 
	A is standing at the start and didn't move a bit but -(-A) have traveled the whole circle before coming 
	back to the start point but we don't have any mathematics to show that.</p>
<p>I feel it need a study and can find an application in many fields of Computer Science.</p>
